# topwrite
The code presented here is part of a project I developed tha is named "TopWrite". This is a desktop platform to help languages teachers to correct students texts.
It gives total result of correction as well as graphic at the end showing performance of students. This will diminish teachers subjectiveness during correction.
the code here is only to show how I used "Interactjs plugin" to move the tags (the pins) all over the screen.
Hope it is of any help for you all.
